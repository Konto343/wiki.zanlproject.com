Akhris, or by her true name, Enra, is a anomaly which has no known origin. 

Physically, Enra appears as a female feline, similar to a cat on Earth. However, the differences are that she is twice the size and her fur brims faintly along her blue tainted skin. 

Enra has very high level of intelligence, but doesn't show often unless being confronted about something she has in plan. Personality-wise, she is known to be helpful to young children and quite preceptive of situations. 

Enra has a range of abilities, such as flying, teleporting, mind-reading, pyrokinesis, and time-dilation. None of which she refuses to talk about or explain how she obtained.

It is rumored that her appearance isn't exactly the one from a cat, but something far different.

Enra's nickname, Akhris, is a name given by Aeta in response to finding her inside a strange and giant nebula he'd never seen before. They've gotten to know each pretty well, but the lack of memory Enra had puzzled Aeta. The cosmic entities work together, keeping the universe under their sight.

Necrodon, though unable to communicate properly, knows of a strange detail he saw through Enra's soul. It was a blurry image of a strange figure, but it felt like the figure was staring directly at Necrodon. It didn't concern him, but what did is that Enra has existed similar to a moving singularity. Her soul through his eyes only saw one, which hadn't been possible ever before.

Among the multitude to multiverses, you existed infinitely, but Enra was very different. Necrodon decided not to tell Aeta, seeing he'd destroy her unique presence.

## Name origin: 
There isn't a proper process to how i named her, but i came up with "Akhrls" first then it transformed into Akhris (recovered data from old documents)
