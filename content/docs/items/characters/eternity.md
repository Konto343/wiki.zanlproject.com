Eternity is the only primordial entity within it's own creation, the multiverse.

Eternity appears, if ever seen, as humanoid with it's head protruding extremely long spikes, slicking back behind it like hair. It's "skin" mirrors all light that hits it, having zero shadows and roughness. 

Eternity was made from a higher force than it couldn't ever seemed to comprehend, but understood it's creation, to create more. Initially, it's form was no form at all, appearing as a quantum-strange mix of matter.

In the instant it "awoke" among the absence of color, it processed not thought but reasoning. This led to the "Start", or massive birth of the multiverse. As the development of new elements began to form for the first time, time appeared extremely slow. Eternity intended to learn everything that happened at all time on the "bubble" he stood on. It shrunk, transformed, and spun the multiverse like a small ball. However, Eternity came to realize doing so led to major alterations of the timelines inside the bubble. 

It returned the multiverse to it's original size, unable to fix the problems within it without further progressing the damage done already. Eternity transformed and morphed it's "body" to something anthropomorphic, laying down and extending it's hands over the diverse multiverse below it. Two balls peeled from it's fingers, plunging into the bubble, one dimming to pitch blank and one completely white.

Through it's vast knowledge accumulated to this point, ingrained two names into the balls of life, Aeta and Necrodon. However, it was mindful not to include itself in the memory of those, only giving them both tasks to control the multiverse's damage.

Eternity had no reason afterwards, to proceed with anymore interference to its own creation. It feel asleep. However, as time progressed billions of years per nanosecond, a bright white light shone. Brimming through even layers of universes, time, and matter.

Eternity for a moment, twitched, before resuming it's sleep.
