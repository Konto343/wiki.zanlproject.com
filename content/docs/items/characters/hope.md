Hope is a cosmic entity that patrols among universes for anomalies.

Hope physically appears a tall white figure with no head and two sets of arms. On the palm of each hand lays a "eye", which it uses to observe events from extreme distances with precision. 

Hope was created by Aeta to act as a sentry, filtering out powerful entities or forces from entering into the multiverse. In the case the entity is too powerful for its own good, Hope will stand at a far distance, alerting Aeta of the creature.

Hope was born without a head to in order to optimize it's sight and overall preceptive abilities. It's 4 hands were inspired by the amount of eyes Necrodon has. However despite Hope's high-end eyesight, it doesn't surpass Necrodon's, but does for Aeta. 

## Origin: 
Comes from the emotion he is based off, which is “Hope”
